Hi, 

My name is Dennis Oberhoff, and Iâ€™m a freelance software product consultant, primarily specialized in mobile applications. 

In addition to my freelance work, I am also the founder of ðŸ’¿ [Recordfy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/recordfy-the-vinyl-app/id6472716489), a platform designed to discover and purchase vinyl from independent record stores. Besides my freelance work, I'm known as the creator of ðŸš² [bbybike](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/bbybike-die-fahrrad-app/id639384862) for iOS and ðŸŽ§ [DaftCloud](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daftcloud/id1320450034) for macOS. 

I'm located in Berlin and have a keen interest in music and technology. If you'd like to meet for a coffee, just let me know. You can reach me via [email](mailto:dennis@obrhoff.de), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/obrhoff/) or [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@obrhoff).
